<h2>GORMA</h2>

<p>Qorma is a rich and flavorful Pakistani dish, known for its creamy texture and aromatic spices.
It's traditionally made with meat, often beef, lamb, or chicken, slow-cooked in a sauce that includes
yogurt, onions, and a blend of spices like cardamom, cinnamon, and cloves. The dish gets its distinctive
 flavor from the use of browned onions and the slow cooking process, which allows the meat to 
 become incredibly tender and the flavors to meld together beautifully. Qorma is a popular choice
  for special occasions and celebrations in Pakistan, and it's often served with naan or rice.</p>

<h2>BIRYANI</h2>

<p>Biryani is a beloved and iconic Pakistani dish, a fragrant and flavorful rice preparation that
holds a special place in the nation's culinary heritage. It typically consists of long-grain basmati
rice layered with marinated meat (chicken, mutton, or beef), a medley of aromatic spices, and often
potatoes. The magic of biryani lies in its slow-cooking process, which allows the flavors to infuse
deeply into the rice and meat, creating a harmonious and satisfying meal. The inclusion of ingredients
like saffron, rosewater, and kewra essence adds a touch of elegance and complexity to the dish. Served
at celebrations, family gatherings, and everyday meals, biryani is a testament to Pakistan's rich
culinary traditions and a source of national pride.</p>

<h2>KABAB</h2>

<p>Pakistani Kababs represent a diverse and flavorful aspect of the nation's cuisine, encompassing
a wide range of preparations and ingredients. From the popular Seekh Kababs, made with ground meat
and spices skewered and grilled, to the flat and spiced Chapli Kababs originating from Peshawar,
these dishes showcase the rich culinary heritage of Pakistan. Common ingredients include ground
beef, chicken, or lamb, combined with aromatic spices, onions, and herbs. Kababs are often grilled,
pan-fried, or baked, and they are enjoyed as appetizers, snacks, or main courses, frequently served
with naan, roti, or chutneys. The variety of Kababs reflects the regional differences within Pakistan,
offering a delightful culinary experience for all.</p>

<h2>KARAHI</h2>
<img src="Karahi.jpg" width="110px" height="110px">
<p>Karahi is a quintessential Pakistani dish, named after the deep, wok-like pan in which it's
traditionally cooked.This flavorful dish is characterized by its rich, thick, and spicy tomato-based
sauce, and it's most commonlyprepared with chicken, though mutton and other meats are also used. A key
feature of karahi is the emphasis on fresh ingredients, particularly tomatoes, ginger, garlic, and 
green chilies, which contribute to its vibrant and robust taste. Unlike some other South Asian curries,
traditional karahi often avoids the use of onions, instead relying on the concentrated flavors of the
other ingredients. The dish is cooked over high heat, resulting in a slightly dry curry with tender meat
and a delightful blend of aromatic spices. Served hot with naan or roti, karahi is a beloved and popular
choice across Pakistan.</p>

<h2>GAJAR KA HALWA</h2>

<p>Gajar Ka Halwa, a delightful and popular Pakistani sweet, is a rich and decadent dessert made
primarily from grated carrots, milk, sugar, and ghee. This traditional treat is often prepared
during winter months when carrots are in season, and it's a staple at celebrations and festive
occasions. The dish is cooked slowly, allowing the carrots to soften and absorb the creamy
sweetness of the milk and sugar, while the ghee imparts a rich and luxurious flavor. Gajar
Ka Halwa is often garnished with nuts like almonds and pistachios, adding a delightful crunch
and visual appeal. 1  Its warm, comforting flavors and smooth, melt-in-your-mouth texture make
 it a beloved dessert in Pakistan and across South Asia.</p>
